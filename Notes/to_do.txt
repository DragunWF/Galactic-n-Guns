To do list:

    - Rotate the meteorites every frame (Cancelled)

    - Get rid of the unused game assets before uploading the game (Just deleted but don't forget
    to check again when you're done just for good measure)

    - Play test the game and balance out the scaling (Done although it still might need some
    adjustments in the future)
